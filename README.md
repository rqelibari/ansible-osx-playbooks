# What is this?
Those files are the [ansible][1] playbooks and roles I use to manage my local
macOS machine (currently a MBP).
When I found myself reconfiguring the same stuff over and over again, whenever
I created a new user on my system, I made my decision to invest time into
automating all those steps.
